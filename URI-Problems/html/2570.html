			<div class="description">
				<p>Red, Hot, Chilli and Peppers are four students who always meet under the bridge after school ends to play a game called Californication. They draw a <strong>N</strong>x<strong>M</strong> grid on the ground, initially empty, and the ultimate goal is to master as much of this grid as possible.</p>

<p>The students play alternately, always following the same order: Red, Hot, Chili and Peppers. After Peppers, the turn returns to Red and so they continue playing until they complete <strong>K</strong> rounds. In each of the rounds, the player can choose between two possible moves:</p>

<p><strong>L X</strong> -&gt; {} It means to dominate the line <strong>X</strong> of the grid, writing the initial of its name in all the elements contained in this line.</p>

<p><strong>C Y</strong> -&gt; {} It means to dominate the column <strong>Y</strong> of the grid, writing the initial of its name in all elements contained in that column.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Input</h2>

			<div class="input">
					<p>The first line of the input contains three integers <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> (1 &le; <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> &le; 10<sup>3</sup>) and <strong>K</strong> (1 &le; <strong>K</strong> &le; 5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup>), the grid dimensions (number of rows and columns respectively) and how many rows were played.</p>

<p>After that, there are <strong>K</strong> lines, each containing one<strong>L X</strong>&nbsp;(1 &le; <strong>X</strong> &le; <strong>N</strong>) or <strong>C Y</strong> (1 &le; <strong>Y</strong> &le; <strong>M</strong>) type, both described above.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Output</h2>

			<div class="output">
				<p>Show how dominant each player was at the end of the match in the following format:</p>

<p>Ra Hb Cc Pd, where <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, <strong>c</strong> and <strong>d</strong> are integers, representing the final score of Red, Hot, Chili and Peppers, respectively.</p>
